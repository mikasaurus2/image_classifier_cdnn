1. setup virtual environment and dependencies
    
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate

    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. install GUI for python

    sudo apt-get install python3-tk


# make a basic script to output some photos

Use `matplotlib` to plot some images.

Specifically, use `pyplot` functions to create plots and show some images
of cats and dogs.

`imread` reads an image from a file into an array and `imshow` displays
the data as an image.

See `basic_image_plot.py`.
